## Variables Annotations

1. With type annotation, we are saying TS that we are ever gonna assign type number to fruits.

2. If we assign any other type, typescript throws an error.

3. Type annotations can be used on any other type of value as well like instance of a class, built in object

```Javascript
 const now: Date = new Date()
```
